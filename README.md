# Advent of Code, 2025 Edition

It's that time of year again! The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is in its 11th iteration and I thought:

> _Why not participate again?_

So please enjoy (or don't, but that's your problem) my solutions in this repository, until I run out of time and/or interest. As usual.

## Is there a specific gimmick this year?

- [Last year](https://code.dummyco.de/feliix42/aoc2024) we did a "Return to Rust" iteration to get back into my favorite language after having been forced mostly into C++ for work-related reasons.
- 2023, we skipped for some reason I cannot remember.
- [2022](https://github.com/feliix42/aoc2022) we implemented everything as a Flex/Bison parser,
- 2021, I was boring (I implemented it just in plain C, no gimmick, no nothing, not even a Github repo it seems),
- [2020](https://github.com/feliix42/aoc2020) we all collectively lost our minds, so I did it in C++, and
- [2019](https://github.com/Feliix42/peculiar-advent-of-code-2019), my challenge was doing it in as many different programming languages as possible (including bash, Vim, Swift, and others)

This year, I'm not sure yet. We started out with Rust, because that's fun and quick. Stay tuned to see what I come up with.
